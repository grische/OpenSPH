/// \brief Criterion setting time step based on value-to-derivative ratio for time-dependent quantities.
///
/// The value-to-derivative ratio is evaluated for each particle and each first-order quantity in the storage.
/// This criterion ensures a constant relative error of the timestepping algorithms. Quantities that allows
/// for (zero or negative) values, such as all vector and tensor quantities, have to be treated differently,
/// as zero values with any non-zero derivatives would formally lead to zero time step.
/// Therefore, all time-depended quantities have a scale value assigned. For quantity value \f[x\f] with scale
/// value \f[x_0\f] and derivative \f[dx\f], the time step is computed as
/// \f[ dt = \frac{|x| + x_0}{|dx|} \f].
///
/// The scale value can be chosen arbitrarily, it represents a transitional value between relative and
/// absolute error of the quantity. The optimal scale value is about 0.01 to 0.1 of the typical value of the
/// quantity in the run; for density 2700 kg/m^3, the default scale value is 50 kg/m^3.
/// Larger scale value makes the criterion less restrictive (allowing larger time steps), and vice versa.
/// Setting the scale value to a very large number (10^20, for example) excludes the quantity from the
/// criterion.
///
/// The scale value can be set differently for each material. The value can be set by calling \ref
/// IMaterial::setRange and later obtained by IMaterial::minimal.
///
/// By default, the most restrictive time step is chosen, i.e. the lowest time step for all particles and all
/// quantities. This can be relaxed by setting a power (parameter RunSettingsId::TIMESTEPPING_MEAN_POWER) of a
/// mean, computed from time steps of individual particles. This makes the resulting time step more 'smooth',
/// as it is less influenced by outliers. The lower the value of the power, the more restrictive time step.
///
/// \note The computed mean can be quite imprecise as it uses approximative pow function. This shouldn't be an
/// issue as there is no need for exact value of time step.
