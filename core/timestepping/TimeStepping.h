/// \brief Base object providing integration in time for all quantities.
///
/// The integration is done by iterating with discrete time step, using \ref step method. All derived
/// objects must implement \ref stepParticles function, which shall iterate over all independant quantities
/// and advance their values using temporal derivatives computed by \ref ISolver object passed in argument of
/// the method. The \ref step function then calls the user-defined \ref stepParticles while also doing more
/// legwork, such as saving statistics and computing new value of time step. Function \ref stepParticles can
/// also save statistics specific to the implementation, using provided \ref Statistics object, but it shall
/// not compute the time step value. To control time step, see \ref TimeStepCriterion and derived classes.
///
/// The time-stepping object must take care of clearing derivatives, as there can be values from previous
/// timestep, or some garbage memory when the method is called for the first time. It is also necessary to
/// clamp all quantities by their minimal/maximal allowed values. These values can be different for
/// different materials; the range of quantity for given \ref IMaterial object can be obtained by
/// \ref IMaterial::range() const function.
///
/// Temporal derivatives are computed by calling \ref ISolver::integrate function. The solver
/// assumes the storage already has zeroed highest-order derivatives of all quantities. The implementation of
/// \ref ITimeStepping inteface must also assume that \ref ISolver::integrate changes the number of particles
/// in the storage. If the timestepping uses derivatives from different times, stored in separate Storage
/// objects, the variable number of particles can be handled automatically by the Storage object, using the
/// concept of dependenet storages - if you create an auxiliary storage, for example to store the prediction
/// derivatives in predictor-corrector algorithm, simply add this storage as a dependent storage to the main
/// one, and it will be updated every time the number of particles in the main storage changes.
///
/// Timestepping is bound to a single Storage object, passed in constructor, and this object cannot be changed
/// during the lifetime of the timestepping object. Timestepping implementation can create any number of
/// auxiliary storages and link then to the main one, this hierarchy established in the constructor will not
/// change during the run.
