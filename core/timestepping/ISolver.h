/// \brief Base class for all solvers.
///
/// This generic interface allows to use the code for any problems with explicit timestepping, meaning it is
/// SPH-agnostic. It can be used also for N-body simulations, etc. The solver computes derivatives of
/// time-dependent quantities and saves these derivatives to corresponding buffers in given \ref Storage
/// object. The temporal integration in then performed by time-stepping algorithm.
class ISolver : public Polymorphic {
public:
    /// \brief Computes derivatives of all time-dependent quantities.
    ///
    /// The solver can also modify the quantities arbitrarily. It is however not recommended to perform the
    /// integration in the solver (using the time step stored in \ref Statistics) as this is a job for
    /// timestepping. The solver can modify quantities using boundary conditions, inter-quantity relationships
    /// (such as the summation equation for density in SPH), clamping of values etc. It is also possible to
    /// add or remove particles in the storage and modify materials. Threads running concurrently with the
    /// solver must assume the solver can modify the storage at any time, so accessing the storage from
    /// different threads is only allowed before or after \ref integrate; the is no locking for performance
    /// reasons.
    ///
    /// All highest order derivatives are guaranteed to be set to zero when \ref integrate is called (this is
    /// a responsibility of \ref ITimeStepping implementation).

    /// The positions and velocities of particles need to be tracked at the beginning of timestep, the actual
