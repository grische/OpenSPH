/// \brief Density-independent SPH solver
///
/// Uses solver of Saitoh & Makino \cite Saitoh_Makino_2013. Instead of density and specific energy,
/// independent variables are energy density (q) and internal energy of i-th particle (U). Otherwise, the
/// solver is similar to \ref SummationSolver; the energy density is computed using direct summation by
/// self-consistent solution with smoothing length.

/// \attention Works only for ideal gas EoS!
