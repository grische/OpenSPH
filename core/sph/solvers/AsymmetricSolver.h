/// Contrary to \ref SymmetricSolver, this solver computes the derivatives for each particle separately,
/// meaning each particle pair is evaluated twice (or not at all, of course). This leads to generally slower
/// evaluation, as we have to compute twice as much interactions. However, the solver is more versatile and
/// can solve equations with asymmetric derivatives. This allows to use helper terms (like strain rate
/// correction tensor) that require two passes over the particle neighbors; the derivative is completed after
/// the neighbors are summed up, as the list of neighbors contains ALL of the neighboring particles (as
/// opposed to SymmetricSolver, where the list of neighbors only contains the particles with lower smoothing
/// length).
///
/// Another benefit is lower memory overhead (all threads can write into the same buffers) and
/// generally higher CPU usage.
