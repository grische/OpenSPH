/// \brief Class defining additional operators from existing ones
///
/// Useful to define an arithmetic types, without explicitly listing all the necessary operators.
/// The derived class can use all or just few of defined operators. The operators come in packs; if the
/// derived class defines operators +=, OperatorTemplate also provides binary operator +. If it further
/// defines an unary operator -, the OperatorTemplate provides operators -= and binary -.
///
/// Besides these, the class can implement operator *=(float), i.e. multiplication by scalar. The
/// OperatorTemplate then provides binary operator *(class, float) and *(float, class), and also operator /=
/// and operator/(class, float). This 'pack' of operators is independent from the summation/subtraction
/// operators; both can be implemented, or just one of them.
///
/// Finally, the derived class can implement the equality operator==, the OperatorTemplate then also provides
/// operator !=. This pair of operators is also independent from all previous operators.
