## About
OpenSPH is an integrator of hydrodynamic equations using SPH discretization in space, 
currently specialized on simulations of asteroid impacts. The code is being developed 
on Astronomical Institute of Charles University in Prague. It aims to provide a fast, 
versatile and easily extensible SPH solver utilizing modern CPU features (SSE/AVX 
instruction sets).

## Quick start
The latest version can be downloaded as a <a href="https://gitlab.com/sevecekp/sph/-/jobs/artifacts/master/file/opensph_0.3.5-1.deb?job=build_package">Debian buster package</a>.
Install it via:
```
sudo dpkg -i opensph_0.3.5-1.deb
```
The package contains three executables:
- `opensph` - main program with graphical interface
- `opensph-cli` - command-line utility allowing to run simulations set up by `opensph`
- `opensph-info` - command-line utility for quick inspection of metadata of OpenSPH output files

## Getting the code
The code can be downloaded from <a href="https://gitlab.com/sevecekp/sph/tree/devel">GitLab repository</a>.
Using git, you can clone the code with
```bash
git clone https://sevecekp@gitlab.com/sevecekp/sph.git
cd sph
```
To get the latest (experimental) version, switch to develomnent branch using
```bash
git checkout devel
```

## Compilation 
The code uses many c++14 features, so a reasonably new version of a C++ compiler is necessary.
The compilation has been tested on gcc 6.3.1 and clang 4.0.0.
Prerequisities of the code are:

- git (to get the code from the repository, skip if you already have the code)
- up-to-date version of gcc or clang compiler
- QMake (tested with version 3.1)

Another optional dependencies of the code are:

- <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> - needed for graphical interface of the code
- <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2">Catch2</a> - C++ unit testing framework, only needed to compile and run unit tests
- <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel Threading Building Blocks</a> - generally improves performance of the code (enabled by `use_tbb`)
- <a href="https://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> - alternative to TBB, however it is currently an inferior option (enabled by `use_openmp`)
- <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> - provides additional methods for setting up initial conditions (enabled by `use_eigen`)
- <a href="https://chaiscript.com/">ChaiScript</a> allows to read and modify particle data from a script (enabled by `use_chaiscript`)
- <a href="https://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a> - used for converting particles to volumetric data, usable by renderers (enabled by `use_vdb`)
- <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/">HDF5</a> - allows reading files generated by <a href="https://github.com/christophmschaefer/miluphcuda">miluphcuda</a> code (enabled by `use_hdf5`)

The compilation should be as easy as
```bash
mkdir build_version
cd build_version
qmake CONFIG+=version ../sph.pro
make
```
where *version* can be one of:
- *release* - full-speed version of the code. This is the default option if no build version is specified
- *debug* - debugging build with no optimizations (SLOW)
- *assert* - build with all optimizations and additional sanity checks
- *profile* - full-speed build that measures durations of various segments of the code and print run statistics

Use different build directory for each version!

By default, OpenSPH uses a custom thread pool for parallelization. It is possible to use Intel TBB library 
instead, by adding `use_tbb` flag:
```bash
qmake CONFIG+=version CONFIG+=use_tbb ../sph.pro
```

The project `sph.pro` builds command-line launcher and the GUI application that allows to set up and run 
simulations, as well as view previously saved results.

To further build the code examples, run:
```bash
cd build_version
qmake CONFIG+=version ../examples.pro
make
```

## Windows binaries
Building the code on Windows is currently a bit difficult.
Consider using pre-built executables, uploaded to a 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qx4tdiai9epurzb/AAC7dx6mLyuWxFWjQQDYy22ua?dl=0">Dropbox</a>
folder.

## Running a basic impact simulation
Simulation can be easily set up in the graphical application `opensph`, using a node-based editor.
See category 'presets' on the right side of the editor for some basic simulations.

Default simulation uses the following:
- Equation of motion consists of a stress tensor divergence (SolidStressForce) and an artifial viscosity term (StandardAV)
- Density evolution is solved using continuity equation (ContinuityEquation)
- Hooke's law as a constitutive equation
- von Mises criterion to account for plastic yield (VonMisesRheology)
- Grady-Kipp model of fragmentation with scalar damage quantity (ScalarDamage)
- Tillotson equation of state (TillotsonEos)
- Adaptive smoothing length (AdaptiveSmoothingLength)
- Basalt material parameters

## Particle renderer
OpenSPH contains useful tools for visualization of particles. It allows rendering
individual spherical particles as well as rendering of isosurface, reconstructed 
from particles. The color palette can be specified from arbitrary state quantities,
making it easy to visualize particle velocities, internal energy, etc. 
The surface of bodies can be also textured with an arbitrary bitmap image.

Besides the orthographic and perspective projection, a fisheye 
camera for fulldome animations and a spherical 360Â° camera can be used.
